# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to help retain notes and helpful hints I have learned from completing the bootcamp prework.  It contains notes reguarding common techniques and terminologies that I have used in order to deploy this webpage.  Included notes involve HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript and the main topics that I found helpful. This guide will provide quick access to resources that will help perform tasks and projects within the duration of the bootcamp.
